<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your use of the Services (including your account, if you choose to create an account for your use of the Services), and to enable you to enjoy our</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Account Information</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Except as described below, we do not collect any information that can be used to contact or identify you directly, such as your full name, email</span></p>

However, we do</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">collect certain other information that you provide us, such as your nickname, if you use our Services as a guest. If you choose to create an account</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for your use of the Services through one of your third party social networking accounts (such as Facebook)(</span><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s1">SNS Accounts</span><span class="s3">”</span><span class="s1">), you may have to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provide us with your username (or userID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, weʼll</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be able to link your account with the SNS Account and access certain information, such as your first name, SNS Account profile picture and SNS</span></p>
